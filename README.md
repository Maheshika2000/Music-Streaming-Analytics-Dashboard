Music Streaming Analytics Dashboard | Data-Driven Insights into Listener Behavior 🎧

I'm excited to share my recently completed project: "Music Streaming Analytics Dashboard" – a complete data pipeline and visualization journey powered by Python, MySQL, and Power BI!

📌 Project Summary:
This end-to-end data analytics project explores user behavior on a music streaming platform, identifying patterns across demographics, music preferences, and engagement levels.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
Python (Pandas) – For data cleaning and preprocessing

MySQL – For structured storage and efficient querying of cleaned data

Power BI – For interactive visual analytics and dashboard creation

🔁 Project Workflow:
Data Cleaning & Processing:
Used Python to clean the raw dataset (cleaned_music_data.csv), handle missing values, and prepare the data for database import.

Data Import to MySQL:
Created the music_users table in the music_analytics database and loaded the cleaned dataset into MySQL for scalable querying.

Power BI Visualization:
Connected MySQL directly to Power BI and built a 3-page dashboard:

Page 1 – User Overview: KPIs, user demographics, listening trends

Page 2 – Music Preferences & Behavior: Genre popularity, artist engagement, discover weekly usage

Page 3 – Deep Engagement Insights: Repeat song rates, listening time engagement, subscription-tier behavior

🎯 Key Insights:
Engagement varies strongly by listening time (Morning/Afternoon/Night)

Discover Weekly users tend to like more songs

Repeat song rate is higher for Premium users across platforms
